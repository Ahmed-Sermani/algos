# Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the 
# beginning of the loop. 
# DEFINITION 
# Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so 
# as to make a loop in the linked list.


# Time: O(N)
# Space: O(1)
